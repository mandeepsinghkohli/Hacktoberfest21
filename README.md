## What is Hacktoberfest? 

Hacktoberfest is a month long celebration open to everyone in our global community. Whether youâ€™re a Newbie, Student, Developer, Expert, Group, Community or Company of any size, you can help drive growth of Open-Source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.


## How to Contribute? 

You can do this in a variety of ways:

-Prepare and share your project for collaboration

-Contribute to the betterment of a project via pull requests

-Organize an event

-Mentor others

-Donate directly to open source projects


## HacktoberFest Rules :

-To earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). 

-You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your pull requests to count.

-Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub or GitLab hosted repository/projects. Look for the 'hacktoberfest' topic to know if a project is participating in Hacktoberfest.

-The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.

-If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.

-If a maintainer reports behavior thatâ€™s not in line with the projectâ€™s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.

-A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label.

-This year, the first 55,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize.
